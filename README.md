# Linear_Regression_Case_Study

This case study uses linear regression to explore which red wines have properties that make them more alcoholic. 

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. 
The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression)

Only one notebook tier needs to be completed for the project. Tier 3 is the most difficult.
